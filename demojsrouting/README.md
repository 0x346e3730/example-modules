# Demo js routing

## About

This module illustrates how to use Javascript Router [component](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/development/components/global-components/) in a module

It provides a demo page which relies on the Router to allow customers search in PS 1.7.8+. It provides an alternative way when the Router is unavailable in PS 1.7.7 also :)
