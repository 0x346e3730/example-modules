    Modify a block which is not directly rendered in extended template, but in some included file.
    We need to "embed" the same file that is included in original index.html.twig

    Note that we also need to pass the variables as the orderGrid in this example.

    Include our custom css for layout.

    @todo: there is a bug in prestashop orders page, it doesn't call parent() in stylesheets block,
           so until that is fixed, we include the layout css directly here.
           Once its fixed this stylesheets override can be removed and only left in layout.css

  <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ asset('../modules/demoextendtemplates/views/css/layout.css') }}"/>
